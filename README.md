## 👋 Hi, I'm Noor!

🎓 An enthusiastic undergrad majoring in Computer Science and Engineering.

🔭 I'm currently learning Java, and building useful projects for daily life.<br />

⚡ Fun fact:<br />
      🧠 **Curious mind**: I have habit of googling random facts at 3 AM -Did you know an octopus has three hearts?<br />
      🤭 **humorous**: Do you know what is line? -When dot ' . ' goes walking its called line '____'.<br />
